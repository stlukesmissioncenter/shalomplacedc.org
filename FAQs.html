  <h1> FAQ’s about Shalom Place</h1>
  <p><strong>What is the cost?</strong><br />
    $30 per night per person.  </p>
  <p>    <strong>Who can stay?</strong><br />
    We welcome groups of 10-24 with a social justice mindset.  These groups include: religious organizations (youth groups, confirmation classes, seminary classes, mission councils), college or school groups, advocacy groups (peace and justice organizations, lobbying groups), and other organizations (scout troops, foreign study groups). We ask for a two night minimum stay from each group. </p>
  <p>    <strong>When are you open?</strong><br />
    We are a year-round facility.</p>
  <p>    <strong>Where are you located?</strong><br />
    Shalom Place is located in Glover Park, a small neighborhood just north of Georgetown in Washington, D.C.  Glover Park has many restaurants, a yummy ice cream shop, a Whole Foods grocery store, and small bookstore.  It is also a short walk to Georgetown, the National Cathedral, Embassy Row, and Dupont Circle.   It is near two major city bus lines, which make getting around the city pretty easy.   Safety is always a priority for us at Shalom Place, and although Shalom Place is in the city, it is very secure. The neighborhood is quiet and friendly. People are always out walking!</p>
  <p>    <strong>How do we get around DC while we are there?</strong><br />
    Driving is always an option; however, parking is not always the easiest in the city.  We suggest our groups use either the subway system or ride the buses.  If you are doing a social justice program with us, you will receive both driving and metro directions to all of your service sites.</p>
  <p> <strong>What is your facility like?</strong><br />
    Shalom Place is set up in a dormitory style with enough bunk beds to sleep 24 people separated into 3 rooms. There is a common area with couches for gathering, reflection and just hanging out.  The kitchen has everything you need to cook, except the food.  Grocery stores are nearby if you need to purchase supplies. <br />
    Will we have the space to ourselves while we are there?<br />
    It will depend on the size of your group.  Often, two groups of 15 to 20 will share the space for the week or the weekend.  Our Program Manager will coordinate with both groups to ensure that everything goes smoothly.</p>
  <p> <strong>Is there a staff member on-site?</strong><br />
    While the Program Manager does not live on-site, you will be given emergency contact information while you are here. <br />
    If we do one of your programs, does that mean we won’t have time for sight seeing?<br />
    Our Program Manager will work closely with the trip leader to ensure that the group’s schedule has the right balance of structured time and free time for your group.</p>
  <p><strong>How do I make a reservation?</strong><br />
    To make a reservation please call 202-333-4949.  You may email us with questions at <a href="mailto: office@saintlukesmethodist.org">office@saintlukesmethodist.org</a>, but all reservations must be made over the phone.<br />
    <br />
    Before calling please have several tentative dates in mind in case your first choice is unavailable as well as an approximate number of people that will be coming in your group. </p>
  <p> <strong>How do I get in touch with someone who is staying at the Shalom Place?</strong><br />
    Your group will be provided with the phone number of the facility with your welcome packet.  The facility is equipped with a phone that you can be reached at.<br />
